      I am a M.S. Biostatistics student at OHSU-PSU School of Public Health. Currently, I am taking a research elective with Dr. Karstens's Lab and the goal of the project is seeing if incorporating microbial biomass with the sequencing data would change the interpretation of the analysis. Previously, I was a 2024 summer intern with DMICE Bioinformatics summer program where I work in Dr. Karstens's Lab with the goal of incorporating Fasttree into the microbiome analysis pipeline.
