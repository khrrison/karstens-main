      Justine Nguyen, was a graduate student in the Department of Medical and Clinical Epidemiology at Oregon Health & Science University, studying Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Previously, her masterâ€™s work in Bioinformatics revolved around predicting bacterial proteins in the Ovarian Tumor family through the use of generating features and learning from primary amino acid sequences. Her interests lie in using computational tools to drive lab experiments and aiding in modeling the underlying biology in a system. In the Karstens lab, she participated in the development of an IgA-seq package to help streamline IgA sequencing analyses.
