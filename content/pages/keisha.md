      Dr. Keisha Rose Harrison is a computational biologist with a passion for understanding the intricate relationships between the human microbiome, health, and disease. She earned her Ph.D. in Microbiology and Biological Data Science from Oregon State University (OSU), where her work focused on microbiome analysis and fermentation food systems. Her current work in the Karstens Lab centers on urogenital microbiota, exploring microbial contributions to conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB) and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
      
      Keishaâ€™s expertise spans microbiome analysis, genome-scale metabolic modeling, and the application of machine learning to large-scale datasets. Her interdisciplinary approach combines wet lab experience with computational methodologies to uncover new insights into host-microbe interactions. She is particularly interested in improving the inclusivity of microbiome research by addressing racial and ethnic representation in publicly available datasets. Outside of academia, she enjoys creative outlets like painting and aerial arts.
